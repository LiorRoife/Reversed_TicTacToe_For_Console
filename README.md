This project is an implemntation to "Reversed TicTacToe" Game (using C#).

This game is also known as avoidance tic tac toe, toe-tac-tic, inverse tic tac toe, or reverse tic tac toe. 
More generally, the first player can draw or win on any board (of any dimension) whose side length is odd, by playing first in the central cell and then mirroring the opponent's moves.

In this implementation the player/s can choose the size of the board 3x3 minimum, 9x9 maxmimum.
The project supports player vs player version and player vs computer version which decided before the game starts.
